# Database-Creation-From-CSV
Stored Procedure

This stored procedure is written to create several databases on SQL Server 2014 Express from several csv files.
The initial csv file was very huge and I had to break it up into smaller csv chunks. I wrote a python script to accomplish this.
The design of the procedure reflects the limitation set on the filegroups on SQL Server Express edition.
